byte - 1b
short - 1b
int - 4b
char-2b
long - 8b
float - 4b
double - 8b


1. why char is 2 bytes oif memory
2. what are different data types and their memory size
3. difference between static and instance
4. why static keyword using in java
5. what is the difference between For loop and while loop
